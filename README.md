# Slinky World [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A website where slinky enthusiasts will be able to share their favorite places to use their slinky, and the info about how far or fast the slinky went down the set of stairs. 


## Description:
This project is a website using express and handlebars. It allows users to create an account, and record their favorite locations to slinky. They can also record the fastest times their slinky has made it down the stairs. It utilizes bootstrap for page formatting, and leaflet for map functionality. 

This is a exercise in using handlebars, express routers, object relational mapping, sequilize with SQL for interacting with our database, and node.js.
