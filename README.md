# Project Proposal

**Project Title:** 

Slinky World (Need cooler name)

**Project Description:** 

With our website, slinky enthusiasts will be able to share their favorite places to use their slinky, and the info about how far or fast the slinky went down the set of stairs. 

**User Story:** 

As a user I want to be able to create an account or sign in. Then they will be able to see the best slinky locations, and posts from other users about how far or fast their slinkies made it down the stairs.
